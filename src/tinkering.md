# Tinkering

- A [calculator](https://macmahon.ehrenborg.dev) that allows you to update multistep computations in real time
- A primality [checker](https://prime.ehrenborg.dev) where I got Elm to talk to wasm
- An Elm [game](https://thomas.ehrenborg.dev) I coded up for my brother
- A command-line [tool](https://github.com/TheodoreEhrenborg/ishango) for keeping a running total in different buckets
