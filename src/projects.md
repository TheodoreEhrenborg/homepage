# Projects

- I discovered a [symlink exploit](https://theodoreehrenborg.substack.com/p/symlink-exploit-in-vastai) in Vast.ai and was awarded a bug bounty
- [A benchmark for vericoding: formally verified program synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22908): I was second author on this paper from the Beneficial AI Foundation. See my code contributions [here](https://github.com/Beneficial-AI-Foundation/vericoding/pulls?q=author%3ATheodoreEhrenborg\+)
- [tiny_stories_sae](https://sae.ehrenborg.dev/): Trains a sparse autoencoder on a 33 million parameter language model
- [tiny_stories_rl](https://rl.ehrenborg.dev/): Uses reinforcement learning to encourage `roneneldan/TinyStories-33M` to generate stories with alliteration
- [Looking for feature absorption automatically](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z7iyek97dAeQMxdSd/looking-for-feature-absorption-automatically): My project from when I was at [Pivotal Research](https://www.pivotal-research.org/) (Q1 2025 cohort)
- [CAIMAN-ASR: Pushing the Boundaries of Low-Latency Streaming Speech Recognition](https://myrtle.ai/resources/caiman-asr-pushing-the-boundaries-of-low-latency-streaming-speech-recognition/): Blog post from the machine learning team at [Myrtle.ai](https://myrtle.ai) (my former employer)
- [Poster](assets/benchmarks_ai_fv_poster.pdf) on AI+formal verification, which I presented at the [2025 AI and Societal Robustness Conference](https://www.ukaiforum.com/ai-and-societal-robustness-conference-2025)
- [Slides](assets/engineering_tips_slides.pdf) on engineering tips, which I presented to Pivotal's Q1 2026 cohort
